      What's a croissant you ask yourself? Well, let me indulge you with some
      delicious, buttery pastry knowledge! A croissant is a flaky, airy type of
      pastry, which is popular in France. It is actually commomly misperceived
      as being invented in France, however, it is actually Austrian! The
      delicious half moon shaped baked good can be enjoyed on its own, or with a
      sweet or savoury topping, a versatile hero among breakfast foods.
